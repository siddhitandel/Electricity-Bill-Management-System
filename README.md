Our project is ELECTRICITY BILL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. In this we’re displaying the electricity bill generated in each customer’s account.
We are using Java Frame for the front end of our project and MySQL Workbench for the back end of our project. MySql acts as the database storing system here. Java Frame includes the Graphic User Interface of the project.
We’ve got 7 main tables and 7 audit tables.
The main tables store the data and the audit tables store the changes made like addition,updation, deletion after/before updation, addition,deletion.

The 7 main tables are :-
● Customer
● Account
● Billing
● Tariff
● Admin
● Invoice
● Electricity Board

The seven audit tables are :-
● Cust_audit
● Acct_audit
● billing_audit
● tariff_audit
● admin_audit
● invoice_audit
● elec_board_audit

Our project has two users:- Customer and admin
Admin has been granted all the rights whereas the customer only has viewing and addition of a new account right.
In this project we display the invoice of the bill generated by the account holder, the tariff generated, the electricity board details, the account details, admin details , billing details etc. The GUI is handled using Java Frame.
